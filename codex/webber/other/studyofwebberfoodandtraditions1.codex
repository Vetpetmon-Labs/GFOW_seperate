    "Their Bible is about a female of their species, speaking of how the goddess, whose name is still highly debated, is the only female of their kind, and is the source of their entire race's genetics.
    It also specifically states that if it was ever possible, if two webbers were to mate with each other, it would certainly be interbreeding.",

    Despite how this could cause a civil war[1], no wars of that category have ever happened, as it seems all webbers themselves refuse to damage their own homeworld.",
    "Webbers celebrate holidays like other races do, but as noted on other planets with primitive ones, they can become indescribably wild[2].",
    "[1] A war in which members of the same species fight against each other. Not to be confused with the Civil War from planet Earth.
